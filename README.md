Task 2 Description : 
   Overlapping Line Plots with Annotations: Plot three trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, and tangent) on the same
   graph over the range of 0 to 2π. Ensure each line has a different style and color. Add annotations for key points where
   the functions intersect or reach significant values (e.g., sine and cosine crossing at π/4). Include a legend and grid.
   Advanced Subplots with Different Scales: Create a figure with three subplots: the first subplot shows a linear
   function, the second shows an exponential function, and the third shows a logarithmic function. Use different y-axis
   scales (linear, log, and symlog) for each subplot. Add a grid to all subplots and customize the lines and markers.
   Complex Bar Chart with Custom Legends and Colors: Create a horizontal grouped bar chart showing the test
   scores of four different students in five subjects. Each group of bars should represent one subject with bars colored
   differently for each student. Add a custom legend, and ensure the bars are labeled with their respective scores and
   ordered by the highest to lowest scores for each subject.

Task 3 Description :
  Data cleaning is a crucial step in the data analysis process, ensuring that the dataset is free from errors, inconsistencies, and missing values. This process typically involves:
  Identifying Missing Values: Checking for any missing or null values in the dataset and deciding how to handle them (e.g., removal, imputation).
  Correcting Data Types: Ensuring that each column in the dataset has the appropriate data type for analysis (e.g., converting strings to dates).
  Removing Duplicates: Identifying and removing any duplicate entries to maintain data integrity.
  Standardizing Formats: Ensuring consistency in data formats (e.g., categorical variables should have uniform naming conventions).
  
  Visualization is a powerful tool for exploring and presenting data. Seaborn, built on top of Matplotlib, simplifies the process of creating visually appealing and informative plots. 
  Key features include:
  Types of Plots: Seaborn provides various plot types, categorized into:
  Distribution Plots: For visualizing the distribution of a single variable.
  Relational Plots: To display relationships between two variables.
  Categorical Plots: These are used to visualize data that can be grouped into categories.
  Regression Plots: To visualize data trends and relationships.
  Matrix Plots: These are used to compare multiple variables simultaneously.

Task 4 Description :
  It covers features such as sorting and filtering data to enhance analysis efficiency.  
  various chart types, including pie, column, and line charts, each suited for different data representations, along with their specific applications. 
  PivotTables, for summarizing and analyzing large datasets, detailing their components: columns, rows, filters, and values. 
  Excel functions, such as SUM, IF, VLOOKUP, COUNTIF, and AVERAGE,  facilitate data manipulation and analysis.

Task 5 Description :
  creating interactive dashboards and reports from various data sources, enabling users to visualize data. 
  Power BI’s components, architecture, advantages, along with the differences between dashboards and reports.
  it delves into Data Analysis Expressions (DAX), explaining its syntax, context, and various functions for performing calculations.

Task 6 Description :
  The Onyx dataset provides detailed information on Christmas sales and consumer trends, including transaction details
  such as TransactionID, Date, Time, CustomerID, Age, Gender, Location, ProductID, Quantity, UnitPrice, TotalPrice, PaymentType, and various promotional and satisfaction metrics.
  Data Cleaning
    Using Python, the dataset is cleaned and prepared for analysis. Key steps include:
    Handling Missing Values: Filling or dropping missing entries, particularly in critical fields like CustomerID and ProductID.
    Data Type Conversion: Ensuring date formats and numerical calculations (like TotalPrice) are accurate.
    Removing Duplicates: Eliminating redundant entries based on unique identifiers.
    
  Data Visualization
  Excel:
  Pivot Tables are created to summarize sales by category, store, and customer demographics.
  Various charts (column, line, pie) visualize trends and distributions, making the data more interpretable.
  
  Power BI:
  The cleaned dataset is imported to Power BI for dynamic analysis.
  Users can create interactive dashboards displaying sales trends over time, product category performance, and customer demographics.
  Features such as slicers allow for filtering by factors like location and event, enhancing data exploration capabilities.
